# 📉 HR Employee Attrition Analysis 


## 📌 Overview

This project showcases an **HR Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard** developed using **Power BI**. The goal is to help organisations uncover the key factors driving employee turnover through interactive and insightful visualisations.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce demographics, attrition trends, and job-related factors. It answers critical HR questions such as **who is leaving**, **why they may be leaving**, and **which roles or groups are most affected**, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

I found the dataset from Kaggle [HR Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/hr-analytics-prediction) <img width="1882" height="962" alt="excel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0fe0f6-20ce-4761-b905-b0514ee8d108" />.

## 🎯 Objectives
